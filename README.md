# Flite Sight

Flite Site is a simple yet powerful tool designed to capture and analyze
athletic routines in real-time. With the help of a webcam connected to a PC and
the Veriflite app in Portal mode, Flite Site captures every somersault and
twist of the athlete's routine and then automatically replays the recorded
video, enabling athletes to analyze their performance and make improvements.

One of the key features of Flite Site is its ability to support simultaneous
recording and playback. This allows for seamless and efficient training
sessions, without any interruption. All the recorded videos are automatically saved
to the PC, making it easy for athletes to review their progress over time.

Flite Site is designed to run on Linux systems and uses ffmpeg for recording
and mpv for playback.
