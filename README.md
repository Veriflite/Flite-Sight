# Flite Sight

Flite Site is a simple tool that allows athletes and coaches to capture their
routines in real-time, using a webcam connected to a PC, and the Veriflite app
running the Portal mode.

As soon as the athlete starts bouncing, the app receives Veriflite data through
the portal and begins recording, capturing every somersault and twist. When the
routine is complete, the recording stops, and the video is replayed, allowing
athletes to analyze their performance and make improvements. All footage is
automatically saved to the device, making it easy for athletes to review their
progress over time.

Flite Site also allows for simultaneous recording and playback. As one athlete
finishes their routine and the video replays, the next athlete can begin their
routine, and their footage will be recorded in the background. This feature
allows for efficient and seamless training sessions, without any interruption.

This is an example of how we can use the Veriflite Portal interface and
interact with the sensors from a simple Python script, offering endless
possibilities for custom applications.
